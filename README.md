# Monster Ternary Operator Project

## Challenge Description

I used ternary operators to programme a computer to make decisions based on various scenarios involving Monster Energy drinks. In each challenge, the ternary operator decides between two options based on a condition, demonstrating its utility for conditional logic.

## Challenge Scenarios

### Challenge 1

I used ternary operators to determine whether the user prefers a "Regular" or "Sugar-free" drink. If the preference is not set (undefined), set "Regualar" as a default.

### Challenge 2

using the variable that track the number of Monster Energy cans left in the fridge. I used ternary operators to determine whether it's time to restock or if we're still stocked based on the number of cans left. If the number of cans is less than 5, print "Time to restock!"; otherwise, print "We're  Stocked!" 

### Challenge 3

Based on the current heart rate, determine if the user should drink a Monster Energy drink to boost their workout. If the heart rate is below 100 bpm, print "Boost needed!";otherwise, print "Energy levels are high!".

### challenge 4

Monster Energy drink are best served cold. Based on the current temperature, I used ternary operator to determine whether it's suitable to have a Monster Energy drink. If the temperature is below or equal to 5Â°C, print "Chilled to perfection!"; otherwise, print "Needs a cooler!"

### Challenge 5

Determine if its a good idea to have a monster Energy drink based on the current hour. If It's between 7am and midnight (24-hour format), print "Unleash the beast!"; otherwise, print "Better to stick to water".
